        """ This function sets the impact curve to a sigmoid type shape, as
        common in impact modelling. We adapted the function as proposed by
        Emanuel et al. (2011) which hinges on two parameters (intercept (i_thresh)
        and steepness (i_half) of the sigmoid).

        .. math::
            f = \\frac{i^{3}}{1+i^{3}}

        with

        .. math::
            i = \\frac{MAX[(i_{lat, lon}-i_{thresh}), 0]}{i_{half}-i_{thresh}}

        The intercept is defined at the minimum intensity of a FIRMS value
        (295K) which leaves the steepness (i_half) the only parameter that
        needs to be calibrated.

        Here, i_half is set to 295 K as a result of the calibration
        performed by LÃ¼thi et al. (in prep). This value is suited for an
        exposure resolution of 1 km.

        Calibration was further performed for:
            - 4 km: resulting i_half = 409.4 K
            - 10 km: resulting i_half = 484.4 K

        Calibration has been performed globally (using EMDAT data) and is
        based on 84 damage records since 2001.

        Intensity range is set between 295 K and 500 K as this is the typical
        range of FIRMS intensities.

        Parameters
        ----------
        i_half : float, optional, default = 295.01
            steepnes of the IF, [K] at which 50% of max. damage is expected
